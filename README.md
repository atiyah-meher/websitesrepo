This repository contains a web development project showcasing my skills in HTML & CSS.<br>

It includes <strong>Student Guide</strong>, a productivity website designed to enhance personal growth and motivation for students.  
This site features curated inspirational quotes, free productivity tools, and a self-help library.

It also includes a <strong>clone of the Amazon website</strong> that is built using responsive design principles, layout techniques and CSS box model for spacing and alignment.
