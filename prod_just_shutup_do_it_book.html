    <h3>JUST SHUT UP🤐 AND DO IT!</h3>
    <pre>-Brian Tracy</pre>
    <h4>Seven lessons from "JUST SHUT UP🤐 AND DO IT!"</h4>
    
    <ol>
      <li>One of the hallmarks of fully functioning people is that they never complain, never explain i.e. they never make excuses or justify their behavior.</li>
      <br>
      <li>To be successful in all you do, Eliminate failure language from your vocabulary.<br>Refuse to say things like “I’ll try” or “I’ll do my best. These expressions are excuses for failure in advance.</li>
      <br>
      <li>You have to accept 100 percent responsibility for the person you are today.<br>Acceptance of responsibility is the great divide between winners and losers.</li>
      <br>
      <li>The only way to overcome your fear to do it over and over again.<br>If you are afraid to stand before an audience to speak, then look for opportunities to speak regularly. Continue to do it till what you fear "fears" you!</li>
      <br>
      <li>You learn to succeed by failing or learning from the failing Experiences of others.</li>
      <br>
      <li>One of the things you can do to increase the probability of financial success is to cast a wide net.<br>Keep upgrading your knowledge and skills and gathering more information as if your future depends on it because it does😉</li>
      <br>
      <li> When you decide to become a confident, competent, self-disciplined, and persistent person, and you practice and develop yourself every day, there are no limits to what you can be, have, and do in the coming months of 2023 and years ahead.</li>
