    <h3>Get It Done: Explore the psychology behind motivation and achieving goals</h3>
    <pre>-Ayelet Fishbach</pre>
    <h4>Seven lessons from "Get It Done: Explore the psychology behind motivation and achieving goals"</h4>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Choose the right goals: Not all goals are created equal. Fishbach emphasizes setting specific, challenging, yet achievable goals that align with your values and interests. This increases your motivation and commitment to achieving them.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Conquer the "middle problem": The initial excitement of a new goal often fades, leaving you stuck in the middle. Fishbach suggests strategies like progress tracking, micro-goals, and public commitment to stay motivated during this crucial stage.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Tame your temptations: Distractions and procrastination are major hurdles. Fishbach recommends techniques like pre-commitment, timeboxing, and reward systems to help you stay focused on your goals and resist temptations.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Leverage the power of social influence: We're social creatures, and others can significantly impact our motivation. Fishbach encourages finding accountability partners, sharing goals with supportive people, and celebrating achievements to boost your progress.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Reframe failure as learning: Mistakes and setbacks are inevitable. Fishbach suggests viewing them as opportunities for learning and growth rather than personal failures. This positive mindset can fuel resilience and future success.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Harness the power of small wins: Celebrating small victories along the way keeps you motivated. Fishbach recommends acknowledging and appreciating your progress, no matter how small, to maintain momentum and avoid feeling overwhelmed.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Use implementation intentions: "If-then" statements like "if I have free time, then I will work on my project" can significantly increase your follow-through. Fishbach suggests using these implementation intentions to automate your behavior and make progress even when you're not feeling motivated.</li>
